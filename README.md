# Project_Aim
In a world where most services are available online, identity verification is crucial to ensure that only real individuals can access and use these services. However, with the rise of # generative AI, fake identities can be easily created using sophisticated algorithms. This has led to an increase in identity fraud, as fake identities can be used to gain access to online services and commit fraudulent activities.

To address this issue, a leading tech company is looking for an algorithm that can accurately distinguish between real and fake profile photos produced by generative AI. This machine learning competition is open to participants from all over the world, challenging them to develop a model that can identify a fake photo created by AI. The winning model might be integrated into the company's online services, helping to prevent identity fraud and protect the integrity of online transactions.

Through this competition, participants have the opportunity to use their machine-learning skills to address a critical issue in today's online world, contributing to the development of more secure and reliable online services for everyone.

The goal of this competition is to develop a model that can identify a fake photo created by AI.
 
# Data Breakdown

The goal of this competition is to develop a model that can identify a fake photo created by AI.

To build your machine learning model, we have provided the following datasets:

train.csv: file to train your machine learning model (labels: target variable with 0 being 'real' and 1 being 'fake')
 
test.csv: file that can be used to test how well your model performs on unseen data. This is the file you're going to make predictions on with your trained model and create a submission file.
 
solution_format: Example of the format that the submission file needs to be in to be properly scored

All the images in the datasets are 20 x 20 x 3 (channels). The underlying data is all processed so you cannot convert them back to the original images. The goal of this competition is to predict the ‘labels’ column using the data provided.

The evaluation metric used is F1 score.
